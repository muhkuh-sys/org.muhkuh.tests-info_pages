The "info" and "kip" pages of the netX90 internal flash contain settings, calibration values and chip test results. The chip test results should contain several "Good-Die-Records" which indicate a successful test during the production of the chip.

The "info pages" test step validates all checksums and checks the Good-Die-Records. A device is only marked as "PASSED" if all checksums are valid and all Good-Die-Records are present and marked as "good".

The contents of all pages are emitted as an event, which can be consumed by a database.

# Parameter

The following table shows all parameters for this test step.
The "value" column shows the assigned value.
Some parameters have a default value, which is listed in the column "default". If the default value is not overwritten, the "value" column is empty. Furthermore a parameter can be connected to a system parameter or the output of another test step. In this case the value field shows "connected to" with the source of the value.

# Details

The test step reads the following pages:

 * CAL info page
 * COM info page
 * APP info page
 * KIP0
 * KIP1
 * KIP2

The following checks are executed on the pages:

## CAL info page

 * The upper and lower half of the page must have the same contents.
 * The "ROM func mode" cookie must be set.
 * The CRC32B checksum of the analog parameter block must be valid.
 * The SHA384 hash of the Ethernet parameter must be valid.

## COM and APP info pages

 * The upper and lower half of the page must have the same contents.
 * The SHA384 hash of the page must be valid.

## KIP0, KIP1 and KIP2

 * The CRC32B checksum of the Good-Die-Record block must be valid.
 * The Good-Die-Record block must contain a valid FP record with the result "good".
 * The Good-Die-Record block must contain a valid CP1 record with the result "good".
 * The Good-Die-Record block must contain a valid CP2-0 record with the result "good".
 * The Good-Die-Record block must contain a valid CP2-1 record with the result "good".

Only if all checks were successful, the test step is marked as "PASSED". If one or more checks failed the test step is marked as "FAILED".
